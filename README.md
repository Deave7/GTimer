# APP DEV: GTIMER

My exam project for the App development course.

The assignment is to make a mobile application of each students choice, in my case a workout timer. 


## Tech

 - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
 - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
 - [Expo](https://expo.dev/)
 - [Timer npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-timer-hook)





## Installation

Since this project uses Expo, you need to have a phone connected to the local network or install a android/ios emulator to run the application. 
Make sure to install the npm pakages before you attempt to run it.

```bash
  npm install
  npx expo start

```
